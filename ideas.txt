Vortrag:
- Go through typing rules and their implementation in parallel (split slides) OR even split four ways and compare STLC and DTLC at the same time.
- Point out the unsoundness of the type system implemented (`*::*`)
- Point out that theoretical typing judgements are not directly implementable (Where do we get the information above the line from? Magic hat?) => Why it matters to make the distinction between XCheck and XInfer
- Matrix type as example of application for dependent types
- Point out the novelty of having to do evaluation during type checking
- Before the conclusion: Outlook (Issues & further additions)
- Interlude: Variable Bindings ðŸ˜¬

- EXAMPLES FOR THE DIFFERENT EXPRS/TYPING RULES?

- MAYBE USE THE GRAPHIC TABLET TO ANNOTATE? TRY BEFORE AT HOME AND SET UP KEY BINDINGS FOR THE KEYS ON THE TABLET :)

Ausarbeitung:
- Extend the implementation with recursion and sum types
-
